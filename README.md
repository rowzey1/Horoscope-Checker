##Project

-This is a simple program that uses birth month and day to calculate zodiac sign, and determine personality traits based on horoscope.
-This program uses a combination of conditional statements(if, else if, else) to toggle images with the class of hidden "on" or "off", based on the users input of their birthday, and birth month. 
-Images containing all 12 zodiac signs, and their personality traits are displayed on the DOM, and are all assigned the class of hidden.
-The display for all images with the class of hidden is set to none, so that no images show on default. 
-Conditional statements are set in JavaScript to check the user’s birthdate and determine which zodiac sign corresponds to it. Each zodiac sign has a specific date range, such as Aries (March 21 - April 19) or Taurus (April 20 - May 20).When the user inputs their birthdate, the app compares it with the date ranges for each zodiac sign.If the condition is met,the program dynamically updates the display by toggling the hidden class of the corresponding zodiac sign’s image, making the image visible on the DOM.
