##Project
-This is a simple program that uses birth month and day to calculate zodiac sign, and determine personality traits based on horoscope.
-This program uses a combination of conditional statements to toggle images with the class of hidden "on" or "off", based on the users input of their birthday, and birth month. 
-Images for 12 zodiac signs are displayed in the DOM, and are all hidden using the class=hidden in CSS.
